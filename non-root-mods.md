- Install f-droid from their [website](https://f-droid.org)
- Add MicroG repo to f-droid and install [MicroG](https://microg.org/fdroid.html). Pls note , Signature spoofing is not supported without a ROM that has added support for it. While most things work without signature spoofing, most Google apps will fail to identify your Google Account that is setup via microG. We will need root for that.
